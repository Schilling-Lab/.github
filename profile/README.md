*From molecules to mice to men*

Our research focuses on the development of novel methods in the area of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our group characterizes and validates imaging biomarkers. Interdisciplinarity is an essential characteristic of this area of research which combines the development of physical methods, the chemical characterization and synthesis of molecular sensors, as well as the investigation of biological and medical research questions. This is our Github account.
